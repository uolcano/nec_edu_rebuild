# Something to say
For the server API unchanged, I'd have to deploy the site address under another site on GitHub Page. Since GitHub Page supports HTTPS on June 16 2016, thus I can not use the HTTP uri to get cross site resource. I've written a [blog](http://uolcano.github.io/blog/2016/08/16/How-to-fallback-https-to-http-on-GitHub-Pages/) about it.
