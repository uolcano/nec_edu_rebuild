# Something to say
For the server API unchanged, I'd have to deploy the site address under another site on GitHub Page. GitHub Page supports HTTPS on June 16 2016, thus it means I can not use the HTTP uri to get cross site resource. I've written a [blog](http://uolcano.github.io/blog/2016/08/16/How-to-fallback-https-to-http-on-GitHub-Pages/) about it.
